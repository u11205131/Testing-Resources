Auditability

Log files are not used to monitor interaction in the module ,as nothing is written in the log file . 

Reliability

Security
Interface is not secured in the client side adding Constraint section does not validate user input and adds the given input to the database without any validation ,the only validation is on the server side where it checks if the input is not already in the database.

performance
Connection to the database takes longer adding Constraint response time is unrealistic for the system as it takes longer
